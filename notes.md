Reclone

- user runs `reclone` via terminal (duh)
- gets username? 
  -- check to see if user name exists
- gets repo range (50 or 100 most recent repos)
  -- potential cap on range depending github api
- gets directory to clone to
  -- check to see if repo exists?
- clones them bishes
  -- if just one clone, ask the user to clone manually
  -- let user know if repo range is outside of api rate limiting

Potential classes
- cli class
  refer to old code for idea?

- user class
 #user_name
  checks api class to see if user_name exists?
  

 #directory?

- github api?
